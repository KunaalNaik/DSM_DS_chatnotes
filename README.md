### Day-to-Day Activities of a Data Scientist

A data scientist’s daily activities revolve around extracting meaningful insights from data and building models that support business decision-making. Below are common tasks a data scientist may perform, framed in the context of different scenarios:

---

**Scenario 1: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**

**Task:**
You’re tasked with preparing a dataset of customer transactions for analysis. The dataset is messy, with missing values, outliers, and inconsistent formats.

**Activities:**
- **Data Cleaning:** You start by checking for missing values using `pandas` functions like `.isnull()` and decide on appropriate imputation techniques. You might use mean imputation for continuous variables or mode imputation for categorical variables, using Python’s `scikit-learn` library.
- **Outlier Detection:** You identify outliers using statistical methods such as the IQR method or Z-scores, visualizing them with box plots in `matplotlib` or `seaborn`.
- **Data Transformation:** For consistency, you normalize the data, using MinMaxScaler from `scikit-learn`, ensuring that all features are on the same scale, which is crucial for distance-based algorithms.

**Challenges:**
- Dealing with missing data that could lead to biased models if not handled properly.
- Deciding the right imputation method that doesn’t distort the dataset.
- Identifying and handling outliers without losing significant information.

---

**Scenario 2: Feature Engineering**

**Task:**
You’re working on a predictive model for customer churn and need to create new features from existing ones to improve model performance.

**Activities:**
- **Creating New Features:** You engineer features like `average_order_value`, `frequency_of_purchases`, and `days_since_last_purchase` using SQL queries to aggregate transaction data.
- **Feature Selection:** You use Python libraries like `pandas` and `numpy` to calculate correlation matrices and select features that show high correlation with the target variable but low correlation with each other to avoid multicollinearity.
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** You apply techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce feature dimensionality while retaining most of the variance, helping to prevent overfitting.

**Challenges:**
- Ensuring new features are relevant and capture the essence of the problem.
- Balancing the number of features to avoid the curse of dimensionality.
- Maintaining the interpretability of the model while using advanced feature engineering techniques.

---

**Scenario 3: Model Development and Evaluation**

**Task:**
You are developing a machine learning model to predict customer churn and need to evaluate its performance.

**Activities:**
- **Model Selection:** You experiment with various algorithms such as logistic regression, random forests, and gradient boosting, selecting the best-performing model using cross-validation techniques like k-fold validation.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Using `GridSearchCV` or `RandomizedSearchCV` in `scikit-learn`, you fine-tune hyperparameters like learning rate, max_depth, and number of estimators to optimize model performance.
- **Model Evaluation:** You evaluate the model using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC. You might also use a confusion matrix to visualize the performance of classification models.

**Challenges:**
- Choosing the right model that balances bias and variance, preventing overfitting or underfitting.
- Ensuring that the model generalizes well to unseen data, which is validated by good cross-validation scores.
- Interpreting the results and ensuring that the model’s predictions are actionable for business stakeholders.

---

**Scenario 4: Data Querying and Integration**

**Task:**
You need to integrate multiple data sources to create a unified dataset for analysis.

**Activities:**
- **SQL Querying:** You write complex SQL queries to join tables from different databases, applying filtering, grouping, and aggregation functions to ensure the data is correctly merged.
- **Data Integration:** After extracting the data using SQL, you use Python (`pandas`) to merge different datasets into a single DataFrame, ensuring that there are no duplicate entries and that data types are consistent across columns.
- **Validation:** You validate the integrated dataset by checking for any inconsistencies, such as mismatches in keys used for joining, missing values, or incorrect data types.

**Challenges:**
- Writing efficient SQL queries that can handle large datasets without performance issues.
- Ensuring the integrity and consistency of the data when integrating from multiple sources.
- Handling any discrepancies or conflicts in data that arise from the integration process.

---

**Scenario 5: Deployment and Monitoring of Models**

**Task:**
You have successfully built a predictive model, and now you need to deploy it into production.

**Activities:**
- **Model Deployment:** You deploy the model using AWS SageMaker or a similar service, ensuring it can scale as required. You might containerize the model using Docker and deploy it on Kubernetes for more complex scenarios.
- **Monitoring:** You set up monitoring tools to track the model’s performance in production, ensuring it doesn’t degrade over time. This might include setting up alerts for when performance metrics like accuracy or response time deviate from expected ranges.
- **Updating the Model:** Based on monitoring feedback, you periodically retrain the model with new data or update its parameters to maintain accuracy.

**Challenges:**
- Ensuring the model performs well in a live environment, which often has different data distributions compared to the training set.
- Balancing the need for real-time predictions with the computational cost of the model.
- Continuously monitoring and updating the model to avoid performance drift over time.

This structured approach to describing a data scientist’s day-to-day work demonstrates an expert understanding of both technical and practical challenges, covering everything from data preprocessing to deployment and monitoring of models.


### Outlier Detection Using IQR and Z-Score Methods

#### Scenario:
You have a dataset of customer ages and want to identify and visualize outliers.

#### **Dataset Example**:
```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample dataset
data = {'CustomerID': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
        'Age': [22, 25, 29, 31, 35, 40, 45, 200, 50, 55]}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
```

### **Method 1: Using IQR Method**

**Bad Code Example:**
```python
import numpy as np

# Calculate IQR
Q1 = np.percentile(df['Age'], 25)
Q3 = np.percentile(df['Age'], 75)
IQR = Q3 - Q1

# Identify outliers
outliers = df[(df['Age'] < Q1 - 1.5 * IQR) | (df['Age'] > Q3 + 1.5 * IQR)]

print(outliers)
```
**Issues with Bad Code:**
- Uses `np.percentile()` instead of the more readable and flexible `pandas` methods.
- Doesn't handle potential NaN values or unexpected data types.
- No comments or explanations, which makes the code harder to understand.
- Lacks proper visualization to help interpret the outliers.

**Best Code Example:**
```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Calculate Q1 (25th percentile) and Q3 (75th percentile)
Q1 = df['Age'].quantile(0.25)
Q3 = df['Age'].quantile(0.75)
IQR = Q3 - Q1

# Define outlier boundaries
lower_bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
upper_bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR

# Identify outliers
outliers = df[(df['Age'] < lower_bound) | (df['Age'] > upper_bound)]

# Print outliers
print("Outliers detected:\n", outliers)

# Visualization
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.boxplot(x=df['Age'])
plt.title('Box Plot of Customer Ages')
plt.show()
```
**Why This is Best:**
- Uses `pandas` methods like `.quantile()` for readability and flexibility.
- Clearly defines the lower and upper bounds for outliers, making the code easier to understand.
- Provides a visualization (box plot) to help interpret the outliers.
- Code is well-commented and easy to follow.

### **Method 2: Using Z-Score Method**

**Bad Code Example:**
```python
from scipy import stats

# Calculate Z-scores
df['z_score'] = (df['Age'] - df['Age'].mean()) / df['Age'].std()

# Identify outliers
outliers = df[(df['z_score'] < -3) | (df['z_score'] > 3)]

print(outliers)
```
**Issues with Bad Code:**
- Hardcodes the Z-score threshold without explanation.
- Fails to drop the unnecessary `z_score` column afterward, potentially cluttering the DataFrame.
- No visualization or context for the chosen threshold.
- Doesn't handle edge cases like small datasets where mean and standard deviation might be misleading.

**Best Code Example:**
```python
from scipy import stats
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Calculate Z-scores
df['Z-Score'] = stats.zscore(df['Age'])

# Define Z-score threshold
threshold = 3

# Identify outliers
outliers = df[(df['Z-Score'].abs() > threshold)]

# Print outliers
print("Outliers detected using Z-Score:\n", outliers)

# Visualization
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.histplot(df['Z-Score'], kde=True, bins=20)
plt.axvline(x=threshold, color='red', linestyle='--')
plt.axvline(x=-threshold, color='red', linestyle='--')
plt.title('Histogram of Z-Scores with Outlier Thresholds')
plt.show()
```
**Why This is Best:**
- Uses `stats.zscore()` for concise and accurate Z-score calculations.
- Explicitly defines and explains the Z-score threshold for clarity.
- Visualizes the Z-score distribution with threshold lines, aiding in understanding outliers.
- The code is clean, with informative comments, and avoids cluttering the DataFrame with temporary columns.

### **Conclusion:**
The best code examples are not only functionally correct but also emphasize readability, flexibility, and proper visualization. These practices help ensure that the code is maintainable, easy to understand, and communicates the results effectively.
